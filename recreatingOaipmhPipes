Recreating OAI-PMH Pipes in Primo VE
WSU | Blake Galbreath | blake.galbreath@wsu.edu

1. Gather pipe info from PBO
PBO Home > Publishing > Pipe List > Edit
Jot down the details or take a screenshot.
 
2. Use pipe info to create a Discovery Import Profile in VE
Discovery > Loading External Data Sources > Discovery Import Profiles > Add New Profile
Choose Profile Type = Discovery

2A. Profile Details Tab
Fill in required fields. They made this part really easy – so nice!
If using OAI-PMH harvesting, the set names will auto-populate in the following step, but you need to know what they are called in the current step. Use your OAI-PMH URL with parameter “verb=ListSets” to view a list, such as: https://content.libraries.wsu.edu/oai/oai.php/request?verb=ListSets.
...
<setSpec>mccaw</setSpec>
<setName>J. Elroy McCaw Memorial Film Collection</setName>
...
 
Notes: The Data Source Code you create here (e.g., WSU_CDM_mccaw) will be used to create the custom scope in #3. The Data Source Label will be mapped to the out-of-the-box dc.source field.
When you select OAI as the import protocol, the OAI Details screen will open. Fill in required fields. Connect and edit. Select the set you are interested in for the recreation of this particular pipe.
 
Note: Don’t forget to set the Harvest Start Date to a date before the <datestamp> value of the records. To view individual records, use parameter “verb=ListRecords” and set name, such as:
https://content.libraries.wsu.edu/oai/oai.php/request?verb=ListRecords&set=rcbutler&metadataPrefix=oai_dc

2B. Normalization Tab
Map field not present or manipulate metadata in some way
None needed for now.

2C. Delivery Tab
Link to Resource
Use this area to create View It or Get It linking structures.
If you are linking back to an external resource (such as Special Collections or ArchivesWest), you will most likely use the dc:identifier field to do so. I set this field up as LinkingParameter1.
 
You can edit LinkingParameter1 to use a specific dc:identifier value (matching string) or alter the value (normalization). In this case, the field repeats, but I don’t want to display all three instances in my View It area. I used a regular expression to select the dc:identifier that started with http:// or https://.
 
Use source tag = Matching string using a regular expression
Matching string = ^(?:http(s)?:\/\/).*
Normalization source tag = No normalization 

Add $$LinkingParameter1 via the Template option (don’t forget the $$). Update the Link Label to something user-friendly.
 
Save and Run the import profile, check the results to see that the regular expression filter is working.
 
Link to Thumbnail
Use this area to define URLs for thumbnail images.
This will be highly specific to your data, but I edited dc:identifier in LinkingParameter2 and dc:identifier in LinkingParameter3 to create a working thumbnail image for our collections.

dc:identifier in LinkingParameter2 to collect the Collection Name
Use source tag = Matching string using a regular expression
Matching string = ^(?:http(s)?:\/\/).*
Normalization source tag = collection\/(.*)\/id

dc:identifier in LinkingParameter3 to collect the Collection ID
Use source tag = Matching string using a regular expression
Matching string = ^(?:http(s)?:\/\/).*
Normalization source tag = id\/([0-9]+)

Combine $$LinkingParameter2 and $$LinkingParameter3 via Template option to create thumbnail URL: https://content.libraries.wsu.edu/digital/api/singleitem/collection/$$LinkingParameter2/id/$$LinkingParameter3/thumbnail
 
3. Create a Custom Local Data Scope
Discovery > Search Configuration > Search Profiles > Custom Local Data Scopes > Add a Custom Scope
Fill in the required fields and Add a Condition (under Scope Conditions). Note: The Scope Code you create here will be used to create the Custom Search Profile in #4.
 
Search Index = Inventory: External data source
Operator = Equals
Value = Data Source Code you created in #2
 
4. Create a Custom Search Profile
Now that you have scopes created, you can build this out any way you like, but creating a new search profile made the most sense to me.
Discovery > Search Configuration > Search Profiles > Search Profiles
Add a Search Profile
 
Scope Type = Custom (Local data)
Custom Scope = Scope Codes you created in #3.
 
5. Add the Search Profile to a Search Profile Slot
Discovery > Display Configuration > Configure Views > Edit > Search Profile Slot > Edit
Activate Search Profile created in #4
 
If desired, reposition the Search Profile to appear in a different ordering.
 
6. Test your external data sources
Use an appropriate keyword within your new Search Profile to bring back results.
 
Does it bring back the correct number of records? Do they show the correct metadata? Do they have thumbnails?
 
7. Change Resource Types
Configuration > Discovery > Loading External Data Sources > Dublin Core Type to Discovery Type Mapping
Review the dc:type values found in your records.
 
Map new entries for the dc:type values found in your records.
 
Return to your Discovery Import Profile and Reload the records. Test that the resource type changed accordingly.
